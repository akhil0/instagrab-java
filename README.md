# instagrab-java
Simple Grabber for Instagram pics (extracts pic url)

Requirements :

1) Java
2) Maven
3) GNUmake


Steps :

1) CD to the project folder and run 'make jar' command
2) Run the project with 'make run ex_url', where ex_url is the url of the instagram pic you want to grab.

Thoughts:

1) Opening chrome doesn't have native support, so planning to move to JS
2) Will pack it up as extension for Google chrome to make it more integrated.
